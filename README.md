# EV-Battery-Level-Indicator-Using-ATtiny85-7-Segment-Display
 This project monitors and displays the voltage level of an electric vehicle (EV) battery using a microcontroller-based setup. The  system uses analog voltage sampling, voltage regulation, and a 74HC595 shift register to drive a 7-segment LED display, all  designed and tested using KiCad.
